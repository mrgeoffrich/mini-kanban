// shipped Export; Phase 3 adds Import; Phase 4 will add the
// pull/commit/push shell as Run().
//
// Actor is recorded against any audit op the sync engine writes
// (none directly; the cli layer wraps each phase with its own
// recordOp call, but the field is here so a future internal audit
// path doesn't have to thread it in twice).
//
// DryRun is honoured (where it makes sense) by every method on
// Engine. Export honours it by short-circuiting before any
// filesystem write; Import honours it by rolling back the outer
// transaction before commit.

	// moved into internal/identity, sync was free to depend on store
	// directly. Tests use store.Open(":memory:") for the real schema.
